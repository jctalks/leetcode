# Intuition

The problem can be approached using a greedy strategy. The intuition behind the solution is to keep track of the maximum reachable position from the current position. We take jumps whenever we reach the maximum reachable position from the previous jump.

By iterating through the array, we update the maximum reachable position at each index by considering the maximum of the current maximum reachable position and the sum of the current index and the value at that index. This ensures that we always have the farthest position we can reach from the current position.

Whenever the current index reaches the current position, it means we have reached the maximum reachable position from the previous jump, and we need to take another jump. We update the current position to the new maximum reachable position and increment the jump count.

# Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def jump(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        if n <= 1:
            return 0

        jumps = 0
        currentPos = 0
        maxReach = 0

        for i in range(n - 1):
            maxReach = max(maxReach, i + nums[i])
            if i == currentPos:
                jumps += 1
                currentPos = maxReach

        return jumps
```

# Approach

1. We first check the size of the input array `nums`. If it contains only one element or is empty, we can reach the last index without any jumps, so we return 0.
2. We initialize several variables:
    - `jumps` to keep track of the number of jumps taken.
    - `currentPos` to store the current position in the array.
    - `maxReach` to store the maximum reachable position from the current position.
3. We start iterating through the array using a `for` loop from index 0 to `n - 1`, where `n` is the size of the array.
4. Inside the loop, we update the `maxReach` variable by comparing the current `maxReach`with the sum of the current index `i` and the value at `nums[i]`. This allows us to keep track of the farthest position we can reach from the current position.
5. We check if the current index `i` is equal to the `currentPos`. If they are equal, it means we have reached the maximum reachable position from the previous jump, so we need to take another jump.
6. Inside this condition, we increment the `jumps` variable to count the jump we took, and update the `currentPos` to the `maxReach`. This means we move to the farthest position we can reach from the current position.
7. After the loop ends, we have reached the last index, and the value of `jumps`represents the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index. We return this value.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: $O(n)$

We iterate through the array once in a single for loop. Each iteration of the loop takes constant time operations, such as comparisons and updates.

- Space complexity: $O(1)$

We are using a constant amount of additional space to store the variables `jumps`, `currentPos`, and `maxReach`. Regardless of the size of the input array, the space used remains the same.
