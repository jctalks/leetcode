# **Intuition**

We can merge the two arrays by starting from the end of both arrays and comparing the elements at the corresponding positions. The larger element is placed at the end of `nums1`. The process continues until all elements from `nums2` are merged into `nums1`.

# **Code**

```py
class Solution(object):
    def merge(self, nums1, m, nums2, n):
        # Set the pointers for the last elements of both arrays
        i = m - 1  # Pointer for nums1
        j = n - 1  # Pointer for nums2

        # Start from the end of the merged array (nums1)
        k = m + n - 1

        # Merge the arrays from the end
        while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
            if nums1[i] > nums2[j]:
                nums1[k] = nums1[i]
                i -= 1
            else:
                nums1[k] = nums2[j]
                j -= 1
            k -= 1

        # Copy any remaining elements from nums2 to nums1
        while j >= 0:
            nums1[k] = nums2[j]
            j -= 1
            k -= 1
```

# **Approach**

Let's go through each line step by step:

1. The merge function is defined with four parameters: `nums1`, `m`, `nums2`, and `n`. These parameters represent the input arrays and their respective lengths.
2. Two pointers, `i` and `j`, are initialized to `m - 1` and `n - 1`, respectively. These pointers will be used to track the current elements being compared in `nums1` and `nums2`.
3. The variable `k` is set to `m + n - 1`. This is the index of the last element in the merged array (`nums1`). We start the merging process from the end of `nums1`and work our way towards the beginning.
4. The merging process begins with a while loop that continues as long as both `i`and `j` are greater than or equal to **0**. This ensures that there are elements remaining in both nums1 and nums2 to be merged.
5. Inside the loop, we compare the elements at the current positions `i` and `j`. If the element in `nums1` at index `i` is greater than the element in `nums2` at index `j`, we place the `nums1` element at index `k` in the merged array. Otherwise, we place the `nums2` element at index `k` in the merged array.
6. After placing the element in the merged array, we decrement the corresponding pointer (`i` or `j`) and the merged array pointer `k` by **1** to move to the next position.
7. Once the while loop finishes, we check if there are any remaining elements in `nums2` that were not merged. If `j` is still greater than or equal to **0**, it means there are elements remaining in `nums2`. In this case, we copy those remaining elements to the beginning of `nums1` starting from index `k` and decrementing `k` and `j` by **1** in each iteration.

# **Complexity**

- Time complexity: $O(m+n)$

The time complexity of the given code is $O(m + n)$, where m is the size of `nums1` and n is the size of `nums2`. Since the loop iterates until either `i` or `j` becomes negative, the number of iterations is bounded by the sum of the sizes of `nums1` and `nums2`, which gives us $O(m+n)$ time complexity.

- Space complexity: $O(1)$

The space complexity of the code is $O(1)$ because it uses a constant amount of extra space to store the pointers `i`, `j`, and `k`, regardless of the input sizes. The merging is done in-place within `nums1` without requiring any additional memory allocations.
